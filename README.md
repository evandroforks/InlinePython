Sublime-InlinePython
====================

A Sublime Text 3 plugin that evaluates and replaces the selected Python code.


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
    wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
    Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
    ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
    (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
    Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
    ],
    ```
1. And,
    change it to the following, i.e.,
    put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
    ],
    ```
    * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
      you will not install this forked version of the package,
      but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
    go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    search for **`EvaluateInlinePython`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

Usage:
------

Add the following key bindings to your preferences:

    { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+e"], "command": "inline_python" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+e"], "command": "inline_python_str" },

You can of course use a different key binding.

Next, on any open file, select a valid Python expression, and press
`ctrl+alt+e` to replace the selection for it's the Python `repr`.
Alternatively you can press `ctrl+shift+e` and it will be replaced with
the `str` representation of the expression. If the
evaluation throws any exception, you'll see it in the console, and your text
will be unchanged.


Examples:
---------

You are writing a `Markdown` document and need to add a line with
70 `=`s. Just type `'=' * 70`, select it and hit `ctrl+alt+e`.

You are writing a `JavaScript` code and need to iterate on the
set of words `['bar', 'egg', 'foo']`. Just type `'bar egg foo'.split()`
and evaluate.

You are writing a `for` loop up to some weird value like `math.floor(42 * 13)`,
which is constant. Instead of calculating it in your head, just
type it and evaluate it (BTW, it is equal to `546`).

You have to write a date that is 96 days up from now. Just type
`datetime.datetime.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=96)`, select it,
hit `ctrl+shift+e` and it gets replaced with `2014-05-12 11:42:20.834988`
(or whatever the right day is).

In many cases you have to type in something, which you cannot easily type,
but you know how to generate it using some list comprehension or other
Python idioms. Instead of switching to the terminal, firing up IPython and
generating it, just type it and evaluate it.


Imported context:
-----------------

By default all of `math`, `collections`, `datetime`, `os`, `sys`, `itertools`
all imported into the local context where your code will evaluate.
That means that `math.sin(123.45)` works, as well as `os.listdir()`.

If you have a `helpers.py` module in your `Packages` folder, it will
be included as well. You can modify the default settings file to add
other imports that you want.


Inject code into the evaluator context:
---------------------------------------

Hit `ctrl+shift+p` and select the `Inline Python: Execute selected code` command
to execute the selected code. Instead of `eval`, which only accepts expressions,
this command uses `exec` with a custom `locals` context, which is later used
for the `eval` commands. This means that you can inject definitions into
the evaluator context, to be used later.

For instance, suppose you have the following code, somewhere in your buffer:

    def swap(s):
        s1, s2 = s.split(',')
        return s2, s1

You can select the code around the function, and run the `execute` command.
After this, you'll have a `swap` method available for use.


Automatic counter:
------------------

The local context also contains a handy automatic counter variable,
under the name of `_`. For instance, suppose you have the following
text, somewhere in your files:

    item -> blah blah blah
    item -> bleh bleh bleh
    item -> bluh bluh bluh

Very easily with ST3 you can select all `item`, append and `_` at the
end, select the three `_`s:

    item_ -> blah blah blah
    item_ -> bleh bleh bleh
    item_ -> bluh bluh bluh

Hit `ctrl+shift+e` and it will transforms to:

    item0 -> blah blah blah
    item1 -> bleh bleh bleh
    item2 -> bluh bluh bluh

In fact, `_` is actually a bit more complicated than that. You
can call it like a function with a parameter and it will increase
a different counter for each different parameter.
For instance:

    item_(0) -> blah blah blah
    item_(0) -> bleh bleh bleh
    item_(1) -> bluh bluh bluh
    item_(1) -> bloh bloh bloh

Transforms into:

    item0 -> blah blah blah
    item1 -> bleh bleh bleh
    item0 -> bluh bluh bluh
    item1 -> bloh bloh bloh

You can use any Python type, like `int` or `str` for the argument
of `_`.
